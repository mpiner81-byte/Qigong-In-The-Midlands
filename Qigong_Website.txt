    <p>
    I was born in Asheville North Carolina. I had the good fortune of living in the Blue Ridge Mountains for most of my childhood.
    We moved to the North Carolina Piedmont where I met my high school sweetheart and husband, Kevin. After college, we settled
    in the Midlands of South Carolina. We had three beautiful children, who are now beautiful adults and two spectacular grands!
    </p>

    <p>
    I have been blessed to teach/direct music for most of my life. I began my career in church music and private instruction and
    then transitioned to K–12 music education. For 16 years, I served as a high school choral music and piano teacher within
    Lexington/Richland District Five. My work in academia also extended to Newberry College, where I taught musicianship and
    choral teacher preparation. Today, I continue to share my passion for music through private piano and theory instruction
    for young students.
    </p>

    <p>
    For years I had wanted to learn Tai Chi Chuan. Like many, I began slowly by trial and error through DVDs and YouTube.
    Eventually joining a Tai Chi class at the Northwest YMCA led by Dr. Dee Gulledge, I received my certification from Tai Chi
    for Health. Driven by a desire to support a family member’s health journey, I expanded my focus toward Qigong.
    I was directed by Ken Cohen, a pioneer of Qigong in the United States, and Clayton Crosley, President of the National Qigong
    Association (NQA), to Master John Munro of Long White Cloud Qigong in New Zealand where I began my formal studies.
    </p>

    <p>
    Through dedicated practice and study, I have earned four hundred hours of certification in Small Universe and Self-Healing
    Qigong. I am continuing my advanced studies with Master Munro through 2026 and have begun specialized training with
    Dr. Matthew Komelski in Roanoke, Virginia, focusing on Qigong and Hunyuan Taiji Gong Fa.
    </p>

    <p>
    I currently teach classes at the Northwest YMCA and Lowman Home and various events in the Midlands. I offer one-on-one and group Pop-Ups, both indoors and outdoors, throughout various times of day and evening. Based on student feedback, it is time to offer in depth areas of Qigong study for those in the Midlands.
    </p>

    <p>
    I invite you to join our community and experience the restorative power of these ancient practices.
    </p>

    <p>
    In peace,<br>
    Lee

<section class="qigong-history" style="max-width:900px; margin:auto; padding:20px; line-height:1.6;">

<h2>An Extremely Brief History </h2> 
<div style="text-align:center; margin:20px 0;">
    <img src="https://codehs.com/uploads/631236931ca1d08e5c87b3f2a75e4fd7" alt="Yin Yang symbol representing balance and harmony" style="width:150px; height:auto;">
</div>
<p>
The art of Qigong began 5000–8000 years ago in China. After working in fields, people recreated movements through dance which
were witnessed in nature. They discovered various movements were helpful for specific ailments. Eventually, most villages
practiced their own basic form of Qigong passing it down through the generations. As it was used for healing, meditation,
and protecting their region, these skills were often kept secret within each village or family. Thousands of interpretations
of the various movements, skills, and specialties continue to this day.
</p>

<p>
During China’s Cultural Revolution in the mid 1900s, many practitioners were forced to become even more secretive.
Only recently has Qigong become available for the masses through immigration and globalization.
</p>

<h2>The Study of Qigong</h2>

<p>
Just as birds have different calls and habits, Qigong has as many different interpretations. However, the basic principles
should be similar.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Posture &amp; Movement:</strong> physical alignment to facilitate energy flow.</li>
    <li><strong>Breath:</strong> varied patterns of inhalation and exhalation.</li>
    <li><strong>Mind:</strong> observation, focus, and intention.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Qigong is a versatile practice that can be modified to the individual’s needs and abilities. Movements range from gentle
and meditative to explosive and dynamic with repetitions varying from once to several hundred.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Some practices follow set forms, such as the Eight Brocades, while others utilize freeform
    and still practice (Zhan Zhuang) based on the needs of body, emotions, and mind.</li>

    <li><strong>Setting:</strong> Benefits can be found in both the collective energy of a group class or individual study.
    Small spaces, outdoors, and different times of day or evening all have an impact on a practice.</li>

    <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> The key to success is independent home practice. While movements can be adjusted for any
    physical ability, it is important for each practitioner to be aware and engaged to avoid strain.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Qigong studies the “inner space” as much as external movement. To understand the flow of energy, practitioners often use
nature-based metaphors for the body’s internal systems:
</p>

<table class="custom-table">
<thead>
<tr>
    <th>Internal Element</th>
    <th>Metaphoric Equivalent</th>
    <th>Function in Practice</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
    <td>Organs</td>
    <td>Lakes</td>
    <td>Storage and regulation of emotional and physical health.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>12 Meridians</td>
    <td>Rivers</td>
    <td>Channels through which energy flows to sustain functionality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Dantiens</td>
    <td>Oceans</td>
    <td>The primary reservoirs or centers of energy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>8 Extraordinary Meridians</td>
    <td>Ocean Currents</td>
    <td>Deep pathways that regulate the overall energy field.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Why Study Qigong</h2>

<p>
As part of the human experience, everyone encounters physical, mental, or emotional pain. If pain becomes prolonged,
whether from an acute event or chronic stress, the body, mind, or emotions can be adversely affected.
</p>

<p>
Western medicine, including the VA, has embraced Qigong as a substantial mind/body complementary mode for health.
Research has shown positive results for:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Physical Health:</strong> Balance, strength, flexibility, blood pressure, and sleep.</li>
    <li><strong>Chronic Conditions:</strong> Parkinson’s, Arthritis, COPD, Fibromyalgia, Lupus, and Cancer.</li>
    <li><strong>Mental Health:</strong> Stress relief, clarity, focus, emotional balance, and PTSD.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Every person’s experience of life is different, and the path to healing is unique. By consistently using breath,
movement, and mindfulness in tandem, you can unlock the potential to aid your body, mind, and emotions.
