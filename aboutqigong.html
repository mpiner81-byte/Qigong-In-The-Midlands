<h2>An Extremely Brief History </h2> 
<div style="text-align:center; margin:20px 0;">

<p>
The art of Qigong began 5000–8000 years ago in China. After working in fields, people recreated movements through dance which
were witnessed in nature. They discovered various movements were helpful for specific ailments. Eventually, most villages
practiced their own basic form of Qigong passing it down through the generations. As it was used for healing, meditation,
and protecting their region, these skills were often kept secret within each village or family. Thousands of interpretations
of the various movements, skills, and specialties continue to this day.
</p>

<p>
During China’s Cultural Revolution in the mid 1900s, many practitioners were forced to become even more secretive.
Only recently has Qigong become available for the masses through immigration and globalization.
</p>

<h2>The Study of Qigong</h2>

<p>
Just as birds have different calls and habits, Qigong has as many different interpretations. However, the basic principles
should be similar.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Posture &amp; Movement:</strong> physical alignment to facilitate energy flow.</li>
    <li><strong>Breath:</strong> varied patterns of inhalation and exhalation.</li>
    <li><strong>Mind:</strong> observation, focus, and intention.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Qigong is a versatile practice that can be modified to the individual’s needs and abilities. Movements range from gentle
and meditative to explosive and dynamic with repetitions varying from once to several hundred.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Some practices follow set forms, such as the Eight Brocades, while others utilize freeform
    and still practice (Zhan Zhuang) based on the needs of body, emotions, and mind.</li>

    <li><strong>Setting:</strong> Benefits can be found in both the collective energy of a group class or individual study.
    Small spaces, outdoors, and different times of day or evening all have an impact on a practice.</li>

    <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> The key to success is independent home practice. While movements can be adjusted for any
    physical ability, it is important for each practitioner to be aware and engaged to avoid strain.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Qigong studies the “inner space” as much as external movement. To understand the flow of energy, practitioners often use
nature-based metaphors for the body’s internal systems:

<h2>Why Study Qigong</h2>

<p>
As part of the human experience, everyone encounters physical, mental, or emotional pain. If pain becomes prolonged,
whether from an acute event or chronic stress, the body, mind, or emotions can be adversely affected.
</p>

<p>
Western medicine, including the VA, has embraced Qigong as a substantial mind/body complementary mode for health.
Research has shown positive results for:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Physical Health:</strong> Balance, strength, flexibility, blood pressure, and sleep.</li>
    <li><strong>Chronic Conditions:</strong> Parkinson’s, Arthritis, COPD, Fibromyalgia, Lupus, and Cancer.</li>
    <li><strong>Mental Health:</strong> Stress relief, clarity, focus, emotional balance, and PTSD.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Every person’s experience of life is different, and the path to healing is unique. By consistently using breath,
movement, and mindfulness in tandem, you can unlock the potential to aid your body, mind, and emotions.
