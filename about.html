    <p>
    I was born in Asheville North Carolina. I had the good fortune of living in the Blue Ridge Mountains for most of my childhood.
    We moved to the North Carolina Piedmont where I met my high school sweetheart and husband, Kevin. After college, we settled
    in the Midlands of South Carolina. We had three beautiful children, who are now beautiful adults and two spectacular grands!
    </p>

    <p>
    I have been blessed to teach/direct music for most of my life. I began my career in church music and private instruction and
    then transitioned to K–12 music education. For 16 years, I served as a high school choral music and piano teacher within
    Lexington/Richland District Five. My work in academia also extended to Newberry College, where I taught musicianship and
    choral teacher preparation. Today, I continue to share my passion for music through private piano and theory instruction
    for young students.
    </p>

    <p>
    For years I had wanted to learn Tai Chi Chuan. Like many, I began slowly by trial and error through DVDs and YouTube.
    Eventually joining a Tai Chi class at the Northwest YMCA led by Dr. Dee Gulledge, I received my certification from Tai Chi
    for Health. Driven by a desire to support a family member’s health journey, I expanded my focus toward Qigong.
    I was directed by Ken Cohen, a pioneer of Qigong in the United States, and Clayton Crosley, President of the National Qigong
    Association (NQA), to Master John Munro of Long White Cloud Qigong in New Zealand where I began my formal studies.
    </p>

    <p>
    Through dedicated practice and study, I have earned four hundred hours of certification in Small Universe and Self-Healing
    Qigong. I am continuing my advanced studies with Master Munro through 2026 and have begun specialized training with
    Dr. Matthew Komelski in Roanoke, Virginia, focusing on Qigong and Hunyuan Taiji Gong Fa.
    </p>

    <p>
    I currently teach classes at the Northwest YMCA and Lowman Home and various events in the Midlands. I offer one-on-one and group Pop-Ups, both indoors and outdoors, throughout various times of day and evening. Based on student feedback, it is time to offer in depth areas of Qigong study for those in the Midlands.
    </p>

    <p>
    I invite you to join our community and experience the restorative power of these ancient practices.
    </p>

    <p>
    In peace,<br>
    Lee
